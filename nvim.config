" General Settings {{{
" General Neovim settings that don't belong in a specific group.

" Use relative line numbers. Instead of showing the actual line numbers on the
" left hand side of the buffer, it shows how many lines away a given line is
" from the line the cursor is on. The line the cursor is on does show the
" actual line number.
set number relativenumber

" Fill in the characters at column 80 as a visual marker for wrapping long
" lines.
set colorcolumn=80

" Expand tab key tabs to spaces. Each indentation is 2 characters each.
set expandtab shiftwidth=2
set tabstop=2
set softtabstop=2

" Show `▸▸` for tabs and · for trailing whitespace characters.
set list listchars=tab:▸▸,trail:·

" Enable the use of the mouse. The rodent should be used as little as
" possible, but it's worth having the compatibility once in a while.
set mouse=a

" Enable the use of folding. Folding is useful when needing to hide
" information that is currently non-critical. For example, this config uses
" folding to group and hide like configurations.
set foldenable

" Enable Deoplete
let g:deoplete#enable_at_startup = 1

" Enable the persistent undo file. This file keeps track of the edit history
" of Neovim, which means regaining the undo history when opening a file that
" was edited by Neovm.
set undodir=~/.local/share/nvim/undo
set undofile

" Make y and p use the _global_ clipboard buffer. This allows yanking from
" Neovim to other applications, and putting text copied/cut from other
" applications.
set clipboard+=unnamed

" Have Neovim check for buffer updates every 100ms
set updatetime=100

" Mappings & Remappings {{{
" All key mapping and remapping goes here. Includes mappings for <leader>.

" Map the <leader> key to the comma key. I find the comma key comfortable for
" quick & common actions like saving or quitting.
let mapleader=','

" Map <leader>w to write the file to disk.
nnoremap <silent> <leader>w :write<CR>

" Map <leader>q to quit the current window with a confirmation dialog if any
" changes have been made to the current buffer.
nnoremap <silent> <leader>q :confirm quit<CR>

" Map <leader>v to split the window vertically and <leader>h to split the
" window horizontally.
nnoremap <leader>v :vsplit<CR>
nnoremap <leader>h :split<CR>

" Map <leader>,[hjkl] to move between splits. I don't know if this is more
" ergonomic than just using ctrl-w+[hjkl], but I'm going to give it a shot.
nnoremap <leader>,h <c-w>h
nnoremap <leader>,j <c-w>j
nnoremap <leader>,k <c-w>k
nnoremap <leader>,l <c-w>l

" Map 0 to go to the first non-whitespace characer in a line.
nnoremap 0 ^

" Map j and k to move up and down visual lines instead of actual lines. This
" way--if a line is being wrapped--I can comfortably move between the wrapped
" lines as they appear.
nnoremap j gj
nnoremap k gk

" Map gV to select the last inserted text in visual mode. Useful for quickly
" indenting newly written code.
